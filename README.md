# online-student-registration-system


this is my first project and my collage research 

Online student registration system is a website to implement the process of student’s admission online, its college observing all admitted students in an organized way which is a significant help to collage employees who are in charge of the process. Through the website students can send required data to determined college where they have chosen to study. Therefore, college staff after looking up to delivered data can respond to students to alert them about any error within their data or to inform them that the process is over and when their semesters start ,  Using this project all departments of the college will be able to manage the affairs regarding to student’s applications while the presidency of the college will be able to observe how all departments are handling their tasks and it will be able to intervene anytime necessary and it can see the data from all departments as well as adding new admins when there is a new department.
